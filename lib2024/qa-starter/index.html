				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				 Version control is any system used to manage changes to documents, computer code, or most relevant to this class, website files that are in the process of being revised. GitHub incorporates automatic version control to make sure you are working on only the most recent version of a give web file, but it also stores all previous versions of your files and enables you to access them. Other computer programs, including word processors like Microsoft Word, incorporate similar functionality.
